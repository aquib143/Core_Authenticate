# Core_Authenticate example without using identity

In this project i have shown how to create login and registration form using asp.net core with real-time example. 
And also how to use session  asp.net  core. We used the "Dotnet core database first approach" for crud operation.

In this project i am using SQL Server for the database. Data script is also available in Repositories.
